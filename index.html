    <h3 class="about-me">A bit about me</h3>
      <p>I've been working in kitchens since I was 17.  Almost strictly high-end ones, at that.  I typically work well with a team and never have to be told to do something twice.  High end kitchens seem to have a militant system they abide by, and helps with the progression to other fields.  I've always been in close contact with computers since I was very young.  Set up a server to run a website off of when I was 21, then soon realized it was a lot of work for one person to handle.  I’ve found a new love for the technical field recently and hope to progress in it. Currently enrolled in multiple online courses to further my knowledge of programming languages, web development, and sound design.   I hope you will consider me for your position even though I may not have the required experience.  Everyone has to start somewhere, and hopefully that's with your company.  Below I have displayed some of the technical skills i’ve acquired over the years of working with computers.
